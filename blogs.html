        <h1>COMBO</h1>
        <div>
            Please do not be frightened by this article. 
Many of the points are expressed in extreme terms. 
Some of the nicest people you know are combos and some of the biggest achievers are  combos.  
The Combo 

POWER 
Some people have the ability to be both Detail  (Left-brain) Dominant and Generality (Right brain) Dominant simultaneously. They can  concentrate on the detail and see it as part of the  overall pattern at the same time. This is a very  powerful combination and such people tend to be  exceptionally gifted intellectually.  
Often, they are brilliant organizers because they  can see all the details in relation to the overall  picture. Therefore, they will maintain a balance  and attend to all the details without losing sight  of the ultimate goal. In contrast, a Generality  (Right-brain) Dominant will tend to ignore or  forget details and a Detail (Left-brain) Dominant  will pay undue attention to the details and lose  sight of the general plan. 
They can have encyclopedic knowledge and work  their way through masses of books. 
Similarly, the Combo can immediately relate  what he is now learning to his general  knowledge.  
THE NEED FOR PERFECTION 
But, this power can be misused by the person  subjecting every decision to simultaneous Detail and Generality forms of analysis. He will analyze  a detail, then look at the result of his analysis as  part of the whole, reconsider his decision, the re analyze it as a detail, etc., etc., without ever  
being able to come to a final conclusion.  He will set up a closed-loop circuit of continual  re-appraisal of decisions. So, like a motor  spinning without a load, he will tend to burn  himself out as each decision becomes a major  intellectual task of endless analysis.  
For example, let's say that someone wants to buy  a packet of wafers. He goes to the local  Supermarket and sees that there are five different  types on the shelves.  
The Detail Dominant will scan the shelves, see  which one takes his fancy and take it to the  check-out.  
The Generality Dominant will pick up each one  in turn, check their weight and price, work out  
best value for money and decide which one is  most suitable. 
Mr. Combo will pick the first type, check the  weight and cost, calculate its value-for-money,  then pick up the second type, check the weight  and cost, calculate its value-for-money, then go  back to the first packet and look at it again. 
Then he will pick up the third type, check the  weight and cost, calculate its value-for-money,  then go back to the first packet and look at it  again. and go back to the second pack and check it over again. 
Then he will pick up the fourth type, check the  weight and cost, calculate its value-for-money,  then go back to the first packet and look at it  again. and go back to the second pack and check  it over again and check the third pack again. 
Then he will pick up the fifth type, check the  weight and cost, calculate its value-for-money,  then go back to the first packet and look at it  again. and go back to the second pack and check  it over again and check the third pack again and  then check the fourth packet again. 
Then he will go back, checking all the packets all  over again.  
He repeatedly checks all the packets again  because each time he looks at a packet, he sees a  different aspect to the problem. There is the make  and there is the hashgacha and there is the flavor  and there is the shape of the wafer and its color  and crispiness and size - for example, if each  individual is large, it is quite filling, but if you  are going to hand the packet around it will not  last long, On the other hand, if the wafer is  small, if you are going to hand them around the  packet will last longer but each will not be very  satisfying. 
And so, Mr. Combo stands by the shelves, driving  himself nuts over what for someone else would be  a trivial problem. 
I told this example to someone who I had  detected as being a combo and he told me that he  had needed to by a new tube of toothpaste that  very morning. He had gone to the store and found  that they had four or five different types on sale. 
Trying to make decision proved so traumatic, he  had to leave without buying a tube! 
TALKING...TALKING...TALKING The combo is constantly monitoring his feelings  and he needs to verbalize his feelings. Usually  when I work with people on their reading, I can  repeat exercises continually with few interruptions. The combo usually has to give a  full report on his  feelings/mistakes/performance/etc. after each  exercise. This means that in the time I can  usually do fifty exercises, I can only do about ten  with a combo. 
However, I must be grateful to the combos because their accurate feed-back has helped me  in my researches tremendously and helped me  gain insights and develop new techniques which  
otherwise would have been impossible. QUESTIONS...QUESTIONS...QUESTIONS Because he has immediately relates what he hears  to what he already knows and thinks about it, the  combo is naturally full of good questions. If his  parents or teachers have the time and patience  and intelligence to listen carefully to his  questions, they will appreciate their quality.  However, tragically, this is not all that common  and often the combo just has his questions  ignored or even ridiculed. He then loses his self confidence and can become very confused be he  knows that his questions are good and he cannot  understand why they are rejected. 
In later years, the combo can become very  embittered when he sees from his own studies  that his questions are indeed valid. 
In shiur, the combo can be a big nuisance,  because the moment the rebbi opens his mouth,  the combo has a question. Usually the question is  excellent but on a level above that of the shiur.  
The rebbi can react in one of three ways. If he is  not all that bright or has not prepared well for the  shiur, he will simply tell the talmid to keep quiet.  The talmid is then effectively quieted and also  given to understand that he has asked a dumb  question. 
If the rebbi recognizes the validity of the  question, he might tell the talmid to come to him  with the question after the shiur. Usually, the  talmid takes this for a hint that the question is  dumb and that the rebbi is being kind to him by  not exposing his stupidity to the rest of the class. 
What the rebbi should do is to explain to the  class the depth and relevance of the question but  
also show how and why it is not directed to the  immediate point and level of the shiur. The  combo will then understand why his question,  though valid, is out of order at the moment.  Furthermore, it will encourage him to concentrate  on the basic levels of the gemora which he  otherwise tends to ignore. 
Because of the combo's intellectual agility, it can  be very difficult to pin him down and accept any  sort of advice. Dealing with such a person can  therefore be both frustrating and painful because  the combo usually does seek help and he does  want to improve and release himself from the  self-destroying prison he puts himself into.  However, while rejecting advice after advice, he  still clings to you, pleading for help and  salvation.  
Usually, the result is that soon the relationship  sours and the advisor rejects the combo with a  sad. "Just leave me alone and do what you like!"  If the advisor tries to impose his advice, the  combo might snap back with a "Leave me alone  and don't try to run my life for me!" And soon  after he will be back seeking help and advice. 
After consultation with combos, it seems that the  most effective way to deal with an obstinate  combo is to "give him over the head and smash  him down" - though gently, of course! 
Who do you think you are? Do you know  everything? If you have all the answers how  come you are doing so badly? Do you really  think you know more than I do? How many years  have you been teaching people? Just look at  yourself - are you anything to be proud of? If you  know so much how come you're in this mess and  can't get yourself out of it? You rejected X's  advice because of whatever and you rejected Y's  advice because of whatever and you rejected Z's  advice because of whatever. Of course, you know  best and they are big idiots for giving their silly  advice but look at yourself! Are you any better  off now? Did you come up with anything better?  Perhaps X, Y and Z are not such fools. Perhaps  you should follow their advice and if you won't  follow their advice, why should I waste my time  giving different advice which you will reject  anyway? 
THE NEED FOR CONTROL 
The combo needs to be in total control. When he  plays with others, he sets the rules and he has to  win. If need be, he changes the rules so that he  wins, and calls the others cheaters when they  keep to the old rules.
In an argument, he has to win and, again, he sets  the rules and can change the parameters so that  he is right. If he is challenged, he gets more upset  than a regular person because challenging him, or  proving him wrong is not only proving him  wrong, but is challenging the whole "virtual  reality" which he has set up - you are trying to  destroy his whole world. Therefore, he will  defend himself with unusual vigor and might end  in him being abusive - to an extent which the  original argument did not warrant. 
THE PROBLEMS 
I. Gemora 
Because the combo immediately detects  inconsistencies with knowledge he already has,  the combo sometimes fails to pick-up basic  vocabulary and learning skills. This is because  his questions divert his attention from the basic  meaning of the text. 
Levi did not do well in his bechina. he did not  know some simple words and could not work out  a simple text of gemora. I assumed that Levi was  new to learning and therefore I suggested that he  goes to a yeshiva which would give him  experience in basic gemora learning. The yeshiva  he did go to referred him to me to check his  reading to help him with his poor vocabulary. 
 I screened his reading-skills thoroughly and  found that his reading was much better than  expected. Therefore his poor vocabulary could  not be explained by poor reading skills. I then  asked him to draw the diagrams and he showed  up as a combo. We chatted and he told me that  he was far from new to learning - that he came  from a very orthodox family and had attended  cheder, mesifta and yeshiva all his life. 
 I explained the significance of the combo label and showed him how his problem was not a  reading problem but an attitude problem. When  he learns Gemora he must first concentrate on  determining exactly what the plain meaning of  the text is. 
Solutions 
The combo must be trained to enjoy directing his  considerable power to the basic interpretation of  the text and regarding that as his challenge.  These basic interpretations are:- 
a. plain meaning 
b. assumptions 
c. implications. 
It might be necessary to train the combo in basic  sentence analysis - subject, predicate, verb,  
object, etc. It might also be necessary to train him  how he can extract information from a phrase or  sentence by asking the basic questions 
Who? What? Where? When? Why? How? By  whom? etc. 
It is only logical to insist that before you can  argue with a person you must first hear and  understand what he has said. Therefore, the  combo should not allow himself to verbalize a  question on the text until he has exhaustively  analyzed it. 
II Making the detail the whole 
A combo has the ability to give a small detail the  significance of the whole.  
"You never help me! I have done nothing all day!  You never answer my question! I never do  anything good!" 
They can see a small defect in an object or person  and condemn the whole because of it. Often,  older bachelors are combos who consistently  reject possible partners because of small defects  they see in them. Similarly, they can be harsh to  spouses and children by condemning them totally  because of small faults in their  behavior/character. They seem to lack  appreciation for others because a small failure  arouses a complete condemnation, despite past  favors. He claims that he does not understand  anything - because he is not clear about one small  aspect. 
A combo can therefore be very hard to please. As  one dissatisfaction is satisfied, another minor  dissatisfaction takes its place, filling the combo's  horizon just like the first did. 
Mr. and Mrs. Horowitz spend thousands of  dollars sending their Shimmie to visit his  grandparents who lived at the other end of the  world.. The grandparents gave Shimmie a  wonderful time. When he returned home, the  parents did something that displeased him. "You  never do anything for me!" The parents were  shocked! How could he say such a thing! "We  just spent thousands of dollars sending you on  such a nice holiday. We didn't send any of you  brothers or sisters. Only you! You yourself told  how much you enjoyed yourself! How can you  say such a thing!" Shimmie replied,"I didn't  really enjoy myself. I only went to please you!" The parents felt like picking up their son and  throwing him out into the street.  
They can ask what seems to be the most  irrelevant questions. "What color shoes was  Avrahom wearing when he went out of Ur-
Chassdim? What did he eat for breakfast? How  many camels did he take with?" Who cares? So  what? How am I supposed to know? But these  questions are important to the Combo because he  needs to get the entire picture, and he needs  those details to complete his picture. 
He can be badly smashed by a small criticism – or built up by a small compliment. 
Solutions 
The combo must be taught a sense of proportion.  Does a small scratch really make the whole  machine useless? Is she really so bad because she  has this minor fault 
You might need to give him over the head - Are you so perfect? Is right of you do demand  perfection from others? Does the machine work  properly or doesn't it? So it has gotten a scratch  on it! So what! Keep a sense of proportion! Is  really important or isn't it? If you think it is  important, will you please tell me how and why! But you always need to show your love and  appreciation of him and your acceptance of him  as a person. You need to give him jobs and  responsibility which show you respect him and  know you can give him responsibility and are  confident he will do the job. 
III Virtual Reality 
The combo is able to work-out how each  individual should react in any given  circumstances. He can thereby make his own  little world in which he assumes each person 
reacts as he reckons. Usually, he will be correct.  When someone does not behave as assumed, the  combo can explain the errant behavior so that it  fits in with his idea of the reality. 
It was the day after Sarah had undergone an  operation. Ya'akov and Rivka, Sarah's close  relatives were staying in the area but Rivka  explained to Sarah's husband, Yitzchak, that they  would not visit Sarah. Since it was the day after  the operation, obviously Sarah would be in no  mood to receive visitors. Yitzchak reckoned that  Sarah, who had not seen her relatives for quite a  long time, would appreciate their company.  However, Rivka insisted that they did not feel it  right to take the risk. 
 That afternoon, Yitzchak visited her wife and  told her that Ya'akov and Rivka had felt it better  that they do not come to visit. Sarah was shocked  and begged Yitzchak to try and convince Ya'akov  and Rivka to come because she was feeling low  and really wanted company to help cheer her up. 
 
 When Yitzchak returned he gave Ya'akov and Rivka the message. "Oh no!" responded Rivka,  "Sarah is only saying that because she is afraid  that if she admits she does not want to see us, we  will be offended. But don't worry. You can  assure Sarah that we understand and of course we  will keep away as she really wants us to do." 
 Yitzchak could say nothing to convince  Rivka to change her mind. When he visited his  wife and told her that they would not be coming  she burst into tears because she was so looking  forward to seeing her relatives. 
Another problem associated with the virtual  reality is the fact that any challenge to the reality  of the virtual reality is actually a challenge which  carries the risk of undermining the whole of the  combo's carefully worked out world. Therefore, a  combo will react far more violently to something  which does not seem correct to him. For  example, if you will tell a non-combo an unusual  fact, he will probably either accept it or disagree.  But the combo might become excited and  exclaim, "But it can't be like that!" and continue  to protest to an extent which does not seem  justified to the non-combo. 
A further result of the virtual reality is that the  combo imagines that he is a paragon of care and  consideration, yet he finds that he does not get on  well socially. People do not seem to appreciate  his sterling qualities. In fact, he might even be  thoroughly unpopular. The reason for this is that  unfortunately, what he imagines to be care and  consideration does not actually fit in with what  the recipient regards as care and consideration (as  in the example above)! 
Another problem is that they can have two  standards. They can insult, because they are  telling the truth and you must tell the truth at all  cost even if it hurts "That's the way I am and you  must accept me for what I am and appreciate that  I tell the unvarnished truth." But if you tell him  the truth about him . . . Phew! Does he get  insulted!!! He does not believe what you say. He  questions your expertise and integrity and checks  up on you by asking others. But if you question  what he says... Phew! Does he get insulted!!! 
When arguing with them, they can change their  parameters off the argument, but deny that they  are changing one iota of what they said  originally. If you say white, they will say black - 
then if you say black, they will say white - and  deny that they ever held differently! The only  solution is to record the conversation - but even 
then they will suspect that you are really tricking  
wants something more – perhaps today is a  
them. 
They can ask what seems to be entirely irrelevant  question, at the oddest of times, when it should  be clear to him that you cannot concentrate on his  question. 
It is erev Shabbos, close to candle-lighting time.  You have just put the blech on the stove and are  carefully carry the boiling-hot, heavy urn to the  blech. "Why is the moon yellow?" Benny asks.  You look at him in amazement! But Benny  repeats his question and looks at you, expecting  you to give him you total attention and oblivious  to the fact that you are staggering with you heavy  and dangerous load and under the usual erev  Shabbos pressure to get everything ready on  time. 
Solutions 
Logically, there are two aspects to the problem.  Firstly, the combo has tremendous intellectual  power. Because of this, he needs to learn how to  control the power.  
"When you go to buy a packet of wafers, how  much do you stand to lose? How much damage  can you do if you make the wrong decision? Is it  really worth while standing and worrying over  the choice for half-an-hour? The whole packet  cost $1. If you stand there for half-an-hour how  much are you losing in wages?" 
Secondly, he needs to learn to be sensitive to  feed-back from other people. 
You want to do him a favor, but does he really  want it? What are his feelings on the matter?  Listen to how he is reacting to your suggestion.  Is he really agreeing or can you detect resistance  in his manner? Do you really think that you know  what is best for him, better than he knows? And  even if you do know better, would you like it if  your friend tried to run your life for you? 
Other Problems 
Apparent Low Intelligence 
A combo can seem so dumb! You ask him a  simple question and he looks back at you with a  blank stare. 
“What day is it today?” 
He looks at you blankly. 
“Noo! What day is it today?” 
He continues to give you that blank stare which  borders on subnormal intelligence. 
Of course, he knows that today is Sunday – but  that answer is too simple – the teacher obviously  
holiday, or a yorzeit, or what? He cannot think of  anything - so he blocks. 
Solution 
You must create a risk-free zone and encourage  him to “just go for it” with no risk of being  laughed at. 
Weird answers 
They can give such weird answers to apparently  straightforward questions. 
“Who is bigger, a man or a boy?” 
He might answer, “A boy.” 
Before you call him retarded, ask him why he  gave that answer. 
He might explain that the word “man” is made of  level letters but the word “boy” has the letter  “b” which goes up and the letter “y” which goes  down, so as a graphic unit, it is bigger than the  word “man” 
Ooops! He is right! But who would think of such  a thing? 
Solution 
If he gives “wrong” answers, first ask him how  he understood the question and how he is  answering it. 
Difficult social life with members of the family All is quiet in the house. The children are playing  nicely together or doing their homework. Benny  walks in. Within five minutes, it seems that all  hell breaks loose in the house. Fighting,  screaming, squabbling! Benny denies doing  anything to anyone. On the contrary, they all  started with him.  
"You always pick on me and you always blame  me for everything!" 
Obsessive/Compulsive Behaviour Disorder Combos with a detail (left-brain) tendency might  develop the habit to repeatedly re-assess details.  This can become a compulsive habit which  eventually takes over many aspects of decision making.  
The sufferer needs to be taught how this is  caused by mis-control of what is essentially a  wonderful and powerful mechanism.  
Borderline Syndrome 
Combos with a tendency to ADD or ADHD  might develop severe lack of self-confidence.  Since they are constantly monitoring and  analyzing their behaviour, they realize that their  behaviour is consistently in error. Therefore they 
need constant reassurance and develop the  "testing" relationship which is characteristic of  the borderline syndrome. 
Combos are Manipulators 
They will manipulate you to achieve their goals.  If you send them to a therapy, they will make  themselves "dumb" and have fun manipulating  the therapist. 
Combos are Survivors 
Combos have the ability to utilize resources for  their own survival. Part of their strategy is to  make themselves appear helpless and become an  object of your chessed and sympathy. 
They "desperately need". . . 
It is "essential" that you . . . for them 
But if you do not supply, they will find someone  else who will. 
Combos can Kill 
It might seem a harsh way to phrase the situation,  but once a combo has "locked" onto a  sympathetic person who can supply their needs,  they can "squeeze" the last ounce of chessed  from the helper without regard to the helpers own  needs.  
The combo can become a "cuckoo", inveigling  himself into the helper’s family and pushing out  the helper’s own family, ignoring the toll he is  taking on the helper’s own health and  matrimonial peace. 
To survive, the helper must establish firm  boundaries beyond which he must not allow the  combo to trespass. He must be cruel to be kind.  He must be prepared to face the combo's abuse  for his being apparently insensitive to the combos  "overriding" needs and be prepared for the  combo to tell others how the helper is cruel,  unfeeling and unsupportive. 
Eventually, if the combo finds a "better" helper,  he will tell the second one how the first helper  "never did anything for him!" 
In Illness 
When the combo is seriously ill, he is an ideal  patient. He will tolerate great pain, bear it with a  smile and joke with his nurses and express a lot  of appreciation. 
But please do not forget

The more the combo recuperates, the less  pleasant he becomes.  
Once he feels strong enough to get back into  control, he becomes less tolerant of pain and  discomfort. He then tries to use his manipulative  ability to achieve his goals. 
Eventually, it becomes almost impossible to keep  him happy, because he always focuses onto the  negative details, and then he can become very  troublesome and even abusive. 
The Combo does not believe you 
The combo has his own ideas of what the truth is.  If you confirm his idea of what the truth is, he  will be happy. If not, he will turn to anyone else,  even if they are less expert than you - or even not  expert at all! Then he will quote them against  you. 
Teasing 
Combos can enjoy teasing. They seem to be able  to home into what will hurt the other person most  and come out with statements like, “Actually I  want to join the army when I am old enough!” 
This seems to be a reaction to a desire for  attention. You need to be a good listener for a  combo. Let him talk and talk and talk and empty  himself out of all the thoughts going through his  mind that he does not really know how to deal  with. Dedicate time for him when he knows he  can come to you and he will be able to tell you  anything he wants and you will listen. 
Solutions 
You can criticize a combo – but only from a  standpoint of love. If he feels that you dislike  him, he will hate you. 
First build him up! 
Give him important tasks which show you trust  him and know that he has a lot of good talents. He can be a fantastic organizer. He is a natural  mechanech – give him a boy to tutor. 
If there is a local disaster – ask him to go in and  help – intuitively he knows what to do and how  to do it. 
Once he knows you believe in him, you can  gently start to guide him to improving his  relationships and way of talking etc. 


The healthy combos can be fantastic achievers. There is a good chance that one is your employer or the  head of your local chessed organization.  
To work with one, you need infinite patience, enjoy their good points, a good sense of humour, a tough  skin, give lots of love - and the chances are that you will get tremendous nachas.
