                <p>As the father of 14 year old child with reading difficulties,
                    it was very difficult for me to see the pain and
                    suffering my son was experiencing, and every
                    day that passed was more difficult than the one
                    before. The class was already learning Gemara
                    and my son was still having trouble reading,
                    until we got to Machon Misgeret.
                    Baruch Hashem, from the very beginning we
                    saw improvement, and by the end of the
                    process it was impossible to believe that our
                    son had had a reading problem. Now his
                    reading flows naturally even without vowels
                    and in Gemara he's at the level of other boys
                    his age.

                <p>We came to the Machon with our 10 year old
                    daughter, feeling stuck. She was having
                    problems with fluency and accuracy in her
                    reading, despite all the help she was getting.
                    She was having an especially hard time with
                    loshon hakodesh, which was what she needed
                    for davening and studying. In the lessons at the Machon she closed the gap in Hebrew and reading comprehension
                    after only 4 or 5 lessons, and after the 9th
                    lessons she was at an amazingly high level,
                    reading loshon hakodesh quickly and
                    confidently. This gave a tremendous boost to
                    her self-confidence, and it's all thanks to this
                    encouraging, positive approach that is truly

                        With siyata d'shmaya, I met HaRav Zobin shlita, who immediately
                        discovered the cause of my learning problem and made the connection
                        between my poor reading and Gemara learning.
                        <br><br>
                        As a result of the tutoring, I experienced ongoing self-growth and discovery
                        as I began reading rapidly and accurately. I was able to actualize my
                        dream and finished an entire masechet instead of learning just a few pages
                        as I had in the past. Not only was I able to read better, but I was also able
                        to understand everything so clearly that everyone thought I was an expert
                        on the topic. I began to enjoy learning and finished most of Shas in a few
                        years, began learning b'iyun, and had a new world open up for me.

                        spent a lot of money on evaluations and instruction, with no solution in

                <p>Learning Rav Zobin’s method has given me the tools to deal with a very wide range of problems with reading
                and learning for all ages and provide real solutions for
                them. Rabbbi Zobin seems to have a real solution for
                almost every problem!<br>
                And all this in record time! What takes other methods
                hundreds of hours to accomplish with this method it’s
                a matter of maybe 20 hours of remediation.
                This is revolutionary!<br>
                What’s also unique is that he gives you a broad enough

        <!-- Haskamos of Rabbanim and Educators

Zvi Zobin is a long-time avreich at Tora Ore and many who would have
otherwise given up and stopped learning tora have been helped by him.
Today's educators emphasize the significance of efficient reading as a key
skill at all levels of learning, yet this area is often neglected. The Zobin
Method assesses and remedies reading difficulties. - HaRav Pinchas
Sheinberg ztz"l, Rosh Yeshiva, Tora Ore
As the principal of a cheder in Yerushalayim, I have found that Reading,
one of the most important tools for students, is mostly abandoned after first
grade. I was fortunate to meet Ha Rav Zobin and learn about his simple
method that is motivating and leads to success at all ages. In my opinion,
his method should be used in every Talmud Tora since it is applicable for
other subjects as well. The method is so simple and enjoyable that parents
can use it at home. - Harav Kreiger, Principal, Talmud Tora
Kamenitz
Zvi Zobin is to be admired. With his deep understanding of the many
factors involved in reading, he has created a simple method to identify
reading difficulties, pinpoint the underlying causes and quickly overcome
these difficulties. In only a short time, the method can deal with reading
obstacles that prevent progress, as it aims to assure success in higher level
studies. - HaRav Vagshal, Principal, Elementary School Gateshead
The book about the method includes a detailed explanation of the theory of
reading and the assessment of reading progress. It explains the significance
of eye function and the build-up of rapid reading in order to facilitate
progress, going from letter recognition and nekudos to the automatic
connection of words and passages. - Dr. Avraham ben Yochanan—
psychologist
Rav Zobin's Method has made a breakthrough with techniques that deal
with the most difficult aspects of reading. As a counselor in several
yeshivas, I'm aware of the tremendous percentage of unidentified reading
problems at all ages. This method integrates the thoroughness of a
scientist with the compassion of an artist. I've found the method to be a life
saver when it comes to these problems. - HaRav Elkins—Principal of a
reading institute in New York City

6

I'm very happy to spread the word about this method. I know of no other
method that is so easy to use and so effective for such a wide range of ages
and assorted reading issue. It's a crucial tool for assessment and
treatment within an educational framework; it’s an excellent method for
any educational institution. - Dr. Meshulam Teller, Psychologist -->
